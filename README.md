# EasyAgro
Agriculture Analytics and Assistance Portal - 
Flask Application with deep learning models working in the backend for analysis 

## Introduction:-

The initiative is aimed at solving the most common problems faced by the farmers through Artificial Intelligence Technologies. In this project we have
incorporated different modules for functionalities like Weather Forecasting,Leaf Disease Detection, Fruit Quality Prediction and Market Price Tracker. 
The monitoring feature will be followed by remedial measures in case of any abnormality. The focus is placed on the design and components of the web
interface that forms the backbone of user interaction in this project. All these models will be integrated to the web page and offered as a consolidated portal. For AI model building, Tensorflow framework and Python will be used. An interactive interface will be provided adhering to the principles
and heuristics of web design. Use of analytics further enhances the efficacy of the portal by retrieving useful information and presenting them in an optimized manner.
